# Valkey _website_ prototype
This is a prototype of what a (in my opinion) better website for [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) could look like.

If this were to become the real deal I would like to rewrite it in Vanilla CSS and HTML in a lot cleaner way. Svelte + TailwindCSS is just my favourite way to prototype lol

Just clone the repository, run `bun install`, and then run `bun dev` to see a preview.
